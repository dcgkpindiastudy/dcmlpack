# dcmlpack

The intention to build this package is to make work in python easy by using packages which will help to reduce the line of codes and to customize all codes that will be written.

Packages Included are:

dcshape(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)

This will print the shape of X_train, X_test, y_train and y_test. While calling the package we will have to pass these four dataset.

from dcpkg import dcshape
dcshape(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)
